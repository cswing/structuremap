StructureMap 3.0 released in early 2014 marked a huge change in the StructureMap internals and public API's. The 4.0 release was
a much smaller release that primarily improved type scanning, diagnostics, and performance. The only breaking changes from 3 to 4 were in custom type scanning conventions, the removal of `ObjectFactory`, and
the elimination of some obscure configuration API's.

Please log any suspected bugs or feature requests on [StructureMap's GitHub page](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap).
